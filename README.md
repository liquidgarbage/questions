# Questions
[link to deployed page](liquidgarbage.github.io/questions)

## Description
I have been writing a questions notebook to help with conversation for 10 years.
I've collected hundereds of questions.


The goal with this project is to digitise my notebook and create a web page for all to use.
I want to put in to practice the web dev skills I have been building over the past year.

I'm using HTML, CSS and Javascript for the inital version. 

I would like to make advanced versions using newer skills learnt such as  Bootstrap, React, and having the questions be an external database. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage
The site can be used to make conversation using the questions
